What do we want? Money?

What do we then do? Work.

What we really want is money, but we have to do something else to get it, since the way the system is, we can't just get directly to money. Something is in the way.

Money is the most tangible of the things, because what we really want is food, shelter, happiness, travel, stuff, etc. So money gets those things. If we could just get those things, we wouldn't even need money.


This is actually very much like advertising. There are people who want to write content for other people to consume. There are people who want to read/consume content that other people write. However, in the current system, those two sets of people are not allwoed to be directly related. A third party is needed. Ads.
