What do we want? Money?

What do we then do? Work.

What we really want is money, but we have to do something else to get it, since the way the system is, we can't just get directly to money. Something is in the way.

Money is the most tangible of the things, because what we really want is food, shelter, happiness, travel, stuff, etc. So money gets those things. If we could just get those things, we wouldn't even need money.


This is actually very much like advertising. There are people who want to write content for other people to consume. There are people who want to read/consume content that other people write. However, in the current system, those two sets of people are not allwoed to be directly related. A third party is needed. Ads.

thus, i think for VOQA, basically what we did with old VOD without thinking about it and simply based on necessity then

i think we can call it "Community-Based Advertising" or something like that

only community members can advertise, and it's only stuff related to the community; i actually believe in and support this type of advertising

nothing scammy or sleazy like keeping track of sites people use and showing them that blender from amazon they looked at a month ago when they're looking for an answer to a specific VO question (i f-ing hate that stuff)

im actually getting ready to write something up about the current state of advertising and money models; i just cant stand it anymore

everybody expects content (or services) for free, and advertising is how content-providers deliver it to them; that's an absolutely twisted system that we've developed

content creators want to provide content; content consumers want to consume content; yet what we're saying is that the relationship between the two can't exist unless a third party gets involved; that's fuckin' nuts

in general, im thinking if people want stuff they should pay for it; if people want to make stuff, but other people won't pay, that's the market value for the stuff and they should give it away for free or stop making it


also lowers the value of advertising because there's way too much of it

ads once cost ___ ; now they cost ____
