title:  "Probability (Arithmetic) Operators"

In case you've ever been confused by the use of arithmetic operators in probability equations, particularly as they relate to logical operators, perhaps the following will help:

in case you have a loaded coin

P(Heads) + P(Tails) = 1 + 0 = 1
+ => OR

P(Heads) * P(Tails) = 1 * 0 = 0
* => AND


N.B. I was either inspired by something to see things this way or that thing actually presented the above this way; I can't remember, and I don't mean to take credit for it.

others posts:

the algorithm is simple

the conversion of strings or images to numbers might be complex
computer science is all about how to figure something out

often, that involves a calculation

even when you dont think you need one

how to tell if two words or pictures are the same?

come up with algorithm to turn each item into a number

subtract numbers

if anything left over, theyre not the same

--an incredibly simple operation at its foundation

TED talks

"TED, with its airy promises, sounds a lot like a secular religion ... The TED style, with its promise of progress, is as manipulative as the orthodoxies it is intended to upset."
Many (though not all!) TED presentations showcase individuals who think highly of themselves explaining in digestible soundbites how they're going to make the world a better place, in front of live audiences who have a high opinion of themselves, for video distribution to online audiences who want to think highly of themselves.

It may not be a religion, but TED definitely has a cult-ish feel to it.

Heard this quip somewhere:
    If, on appropriate occasions, the members tell, enjoy,
    trade, and/or devise transgressively funny jokes about
    their denomination, it’s a church.

    If such jokes reliably meet with stifling social
    disapproval, it’s a cult.
This works for TED as well. I find some TED talks to be really useful. Others not so much. Just like every other group gathering whether it be a conference, educational institution, club, or whatever.
Think critically about everything.

I've been fortunate to anti-work all my life. I've started companies, built technology, made sales, written books, and generally got paid well to do what I love. I've anti-worked very hard. Often 15 hour days for months on a new project. I have a spouse who is a homebird and provides me the flexibility and support I need for that. In return I support the household. I've been reasonably successful. Not rich, but I have a home, a residual income, assets, I can buy nice things, and buy nice experiences. I can provide for my children and give to charity.
There are plenty of people who work, who work more than one job. They turn up, are told what to do, are at the mercy of the politicking of the organisation, get paid poorly, are physically exhausted, are pressured into moral compromises, have little medical or mental health support, have no assets or qualifications to be able to escape, and are well aware they would not be able to find anything substantially better. Perhaps they work 10 hours a day, then go home, cook for their kids, put them to bed, do the laundry and clean and crash.

When people try to compare my effort against those people, and say "look at people like him, he's proof hard work is the road to success!" I find it morally obnoxious.

The lie that work is the road to success is perpetuated by those who are able to anti-work, to maximise their own success on the backs of those who can't.
