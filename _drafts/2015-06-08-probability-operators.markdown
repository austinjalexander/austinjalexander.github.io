In case you've ever been confused by the use of arithmetic operators in probability equations, particularly as they relate to logical operators, perhaps the following will help:

in case you have a loaded coin

P(Heads) + P(Tails) = 1 + 0 = 1
+ => OR

P(Heads) * P(Tails) = 1 * 0 = 0
* => AND


N.B. I was either inspired by something to see things this way or that thing actually presented the above this way; I can't remember, and I don't mean to take credit for it.
