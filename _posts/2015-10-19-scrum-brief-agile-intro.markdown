Notes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction/dp/193796504X" target="_blank">Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction</a>.

1.  Start with a bright idea
2.  Form a scrum team (product owner, scrum master, team members)
3.  Create a product backlog

## Product Owner
*  responsible for maximizing the development team's ROI 
(e.g., by directing the team toward the most valuable work, 
makese sure the team fully understands the requirements)
*  controls the priority of items in the team's backlog (no one else 
on the team is authorized to change the order of backlog items)
*   responsible for recording requirements, usually in the form of user stories 
(e.g., "As a <role>, I want <a feature>, so that I can <accomplish something>"), 
and adding them to the product backlog

### Summary
-  holds the vision for the product
-  represents the interests of the business
-  represents the customers
-  owns the product backlog
-  prioritizes the items in the product backlog
-  creates acceptance criteria for the backlog items
-  is available to answer team members' questions

## User Stories
Each user story, when completed, will incrementally increase the value of 
the product (so each time a user story is done, we have a new product increment).

As a [type of user], I want to [do something], so that [some value is created].

## Scrum Master
*  not a boss, a peer position, set apart by knowledge and responsibilites
(i.e., not rank)
*  acts as a guiding scrum expert, champion/coach/facilator/guardian, 
seeking team cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance
*  the team's deliverable is the product; the scrum master's deliverable is a 
high-performing, self-organizing team
*  constantly available to the team, helping to remove any impediments

### Summary
-  scrum expert and advisor
-  coach
-  impediment bulldozer
-  facilitator

## Team Member
*  does the actual work and so has total authority over how the work gets done 
(e.g., what tools and techniques to use, who works on what tasks, etc.)
*  generates schedule estimates if they are needed by business needs
*  a specialist who is able to work outside of speciality in order to help deliver
a potentially shippable product in each sprint

### Summary
-  completes user stories to increase incrementally the value of the product
-  self-organizes to accomplish all necessary work
-  creates and owns the estimates (if needed)
-  owns "how to do the work" decisions
-  avoids "not my job/specialty" thinking

## Product Backlog
-  cumulative list of desired product deliverables, where products serve user needs
-  includes _backlog items_, also called _user stories_, which are anything meaningful and valuable to produce that satisfy (including features, bug fixes, documentation changes)
-  ordered by descending story importance
-  stories near the top should be small and well understood
-  stories further down the list can be larger and less well understood
-  each item should include the following information:
     +  which users the story will benefit (who it is for)
     +  brief description of the desired functionality (what needs to be built)
     +  reason story is valuable (why it should be done)
     +  estimate for how much work is required for implementation
     +  acceptance criteria to know implementation is correct

## Sprint Backlog
-  team to-do list for a given sprint
-  has a finite life-span (i.e., length of sprint)
-  includes: stories (i.e., unit-of-value deliverables) and associated tasks (i.e., units-of-work that must be accomplished in order to deliver stories); each story will normally require many tasks
