Notes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction/dp/193796504X" target="_blank">Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction</a>.

1.  Start with a bright idea
2.  Form a scrum team (product owner, scrum master, team members)
3.  Create a product backlog

## Product Owner
*  responsible for maximizing the development team's ROI 
(e.g., by directing the team toward the most valuable work, 
makese sure the team fully understands the requirements)
*  controls the priority of items in the team's backlog (no one else 
on the team is authorized to change the order of backlog items)
*   responsible for recording requirements, usually in the form of user stories 
(e.g., "As a <role>, I want <a feature>, so that I can <accomplish something>"), 
and adding them to the product backlog

### Summary
-  holds the vision for the product
-  represents the interests of the business
-  represents the customers
-  owns the product backlog
-  prioritizes the items in the product backlog
-  creates acceptance criteria for the backlog items
-  is available to answer team members' questions

## User Stories
Each user story, when completed, will incrementally increase the value of 
the product (so each time a user story is done, we have a new product increment).

As a [type of user], I want to [do something], so that [some value is created].

## Scrum Master
*  not a boss, a peer position, set apart by knowledge and responsibilites
(i.e., not rank)
*  acts as a guiding scrum expert, champion/coach/facilator/guardian, 
seeking team cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance
*  the team's deliverable is the product; the scrum master's deliverable is a 
high-performing, self-organizing team
*  constantly available to the team, helping to remove any impediments

### Summary
-  scrum expert and advisor
-  coach
-  impediment bulldozer
-  facilitator
