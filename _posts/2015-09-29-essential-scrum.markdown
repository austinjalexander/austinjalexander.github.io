Notes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Scrum-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0137043295" target="_blank">Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process</a>.

Create a **product backlog**, "a prioritized list of features and other capablities needed to develop a successful product." Work on highest-priority items first. "When you run out of resources (such as time)", any items left in the priority queue will (obviously) be of lower priority than those items which have been completed.

Work is usually performed in week- or month-long **iterations** by a **cross-functional team** (designing, building, testing). At the start of each iteration, teams select a high-priority subset from the product backlog. At the end of an iteration, a potentially shippable/releasable increment of the product should be ready. The the team reviews completed features with stakeholders and requests feedback. Based on feedback, the **product owner** and team modifies the product backlog accordingly.
